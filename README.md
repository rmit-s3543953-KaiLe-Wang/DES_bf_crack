# DES_bf_crack
Here is just a simple brute force implementation for DES encrypted text. For my uni assignment work.
The condition is only the cyphertext (output of encryption) will be provided. The output will be 2 meanningful words in length of 4.
This program will use all the keys avaliable, trying to output everything that's possible.
The verification is performed by human.
